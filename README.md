# Selenium_getcharacters.
This is my Selenium Repository

This is my favorite part when I learned python.

I did told that i had 4 year growth with python.

I also got a pdf in python when learning webdev.

Selenium was my favorite and this is one of my first Datascience related repository.

Webscraping is good but its kinda hard because you really need reverse engineering using UI/UX.

its the same thing as fetch API but in Datascience.

the difference between fetch API and Webscraping is their platform.

fetch targets backend endpoints while webscraping targets Elements in a UI or elements in a front end.

I learned selenium in college and It gave me happiness when i learned it.

the bad thing about this is having DDOS attacks in a website.
